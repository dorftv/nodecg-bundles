# DORFTV NodeCG 

While these [NodeCG](https://nodecg.dev) Bundles are used for DORFTV Community TV they are pretty generic so probably usable for others too.

## Bundles
Currently the following Bundles are implemented.  

### Logos
Upload your logo files on the assets tab and select them in the Dashboard.  
There are two panels. One for Live and one for playout.

### Lower Third
Title and Subtitle fields with color chooser for background and textcolor.  


## Usage

```
docker compose up -d
```

Point your Browser to http://localhost:9090

## Future 
Integration with [DOVE](https://github.com/dorftv/dove) Online Video Editor is planned.
